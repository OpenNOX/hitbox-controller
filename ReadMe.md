# Hitbox Controller

## Parts List

1. Arduino Mega 2560
1. (15x) 30mm EG Starts LED Arcade Button

## Layout Template

The default layout template uses 24mm buttons for all buttons except for the "Up" key button, which uses a 30mm button. I am using 30mm buttons for all buttons. I've also scaled the layout template by 25% because I have larger hands.

## Lessons Learned

- Even with the layout template scaled by 25% the lock nuts were tightly grouped. In order to alleviate this the layout template should be scaled to something greater than 25%.
